#### Leadership and Influence:

- Initiated and actively led campus technical clubs like MuLearn, FOSS and Tinkerhub, providing mentorship and guidance to students. My efforts have directly contributed to enhanced personal and career development opportunities within our community. This also encouraged more students to start their initiatives to bring their peer spaces. 
#### Networking:

- Being a leader also means to engage and interact with new people to widen the network. This was one of the biggest challenges I had to face being an introvert. Eventually, I came out of my comfort zone to establish essential connections with many awesome people. Engaging with other leads, technical experts etc is one of them.
- [WebCon-2023](https://github.com/WebCon-2023/WebCon-2023) was one of the biggest collaboration initiatives I was part of with almost 450+ registrations. Managing the discord server to conducting events, helped me to connect with a lot of exceptional people in this field.
- I'm also a freelancer with a team of 4 members, which helped me to connect with many people in the industry.

#### Career Plan:

- My short-term plan would be to help my peer groups in my campus in upbringing them to their best level. I also have a few ideas/projects including learning a new programming language every year.
- My long-term career plan would be to join a reputed company as a software architect and eventually start my own company in developing SaaS applications.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Malayalis are always known to be superb and we can find them almost anywhere. This was a result of lots of efforts from the government, educational opportunities and support for skill development. We are among the many developing communities which I hope will be a part of the top tech ecosystems in the world.
